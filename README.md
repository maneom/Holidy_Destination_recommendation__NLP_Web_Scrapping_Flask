## Holidy Destination Recommendation

The holiday destination recommendation project focuses on suggesting tourist places or cities based on user input. The main idea is to accept a tourist place or city from the user and recommend related cities or destinations.

To implement this project, I first scraped data from the __"Holidayfy INDIA"__ website. This data includes descriptions of various cities or tourist places in India. I then used Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze these descriptions and extract meaningful information about each city.

Next, I developed a recommendation system that suggests cities based on the descriptions of each city. This system helps users explore new destinations that are similar to their preferred locations or interests.

To make the recommendation system accessible to users, I converted the model into a website using HTML, CSS, and the Flask framework. This website provides an interactive interface where users can input their desired tourist place or city and receive recommendations for similar destinations.

Overall, the project aims to enhance the travel planning experience by providing personalized recommendations for holiday destinations based on user preferences and interests.
